# Generate Images for D&D NPCS using a latent consistancy model

In addition to offering an option for regular text to image generation, this tool has a way to automagically generate semi-random descriptions of NPCs and then generate pictures based on those, for example, you might tell it you want a rogue, and it will first generate a detailed description like:

a watercolor image showing the entire body of of a D&D NPC in medieval clothing in a medieval city who is described as: petite extrodanarily attractive female gnome rogue  with sparkling grey eyes, an enchanting  mouth,  a snub nose, and straight  hair wearing a form-fitting black finely-tailored waistcoat, matching black sturdy leggings and brown fur-lined boots"

After creating these images, it will sort them into folders named gender_race_class.  For example the images created by the prompt above would be placed into the female_gnome_rogue folder.
