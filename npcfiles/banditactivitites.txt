leaning against the wall, a sly grin spreading across their face as he toys with a dagger,
hunched over a small fire, their eyes darting up to meet yours with a mix of surprise and hostility,
bandaging a wound on their arm, their gear scattered around him in a disorganized manner,
arguing loudly with another figure, both of them gesturing wildly with their weapons,
sitting on a fallen log, cleaning his sword with a piece of cloth, completely absorbed in their task,
perched high in a tree, bow at the ready, eyeing you as you emerge into their line of sight,
digging through a bag with a focused intensity, unaware of your approach until it's too late,
whistling a tune, seemingly carefree, until their hand goes to the hilt of their sword as he spots you,
gesturing silently to others hidden in the shadows, clearly preparing an ambush,
eating from a makeshift bowl, looking up with a start as your footsteps crunch on the ground,
counting coins with a greedy gleam in their eye, not noticing your presence until the last moment,
sketching something in the dirt with a stick, lost in thought and momentarily vulnerable,
tying a prisoner to a tree, their attention focused on securing the knots tightly,
laughing heartily at some unseen joke, their guard momentarily lowered,
communicating in hushed tones with a raven perched on their shoulder, seemingly receiving a message,
