who is currently sitting at the church steps, palms upturned, pleading silently for alms
who is currently wandering the marketplace, ragged cloak swaying, murmuring pleas for spare coins
who is currently stationed at the castle gate, eyes downcast, humbly asking passersby for assistance
who is currently huddled in a dark alley, shivering, hands outstretched, hoping for generosity from those who pass
who is currently kneeling by the fountain, displaying wounds and ailments, hoping for sympathy and charity
who is currently singing a sorrowful tune in the town square, hat laid out for offerings from the compassionate
who is currently holding out a crude sign in the busy street, detailing hardships and seeking aid from the merciful
who is currently recounting tales of misfortune to anyone who will listen, hoping to elicit empathy and donations
who is currently clutching a tin cup outside the tavern, silently imploring patrons for any leftover coin
who is currently seeking refuge in the shadow of a grand cathedral, whispering prayers for relief from destitution
